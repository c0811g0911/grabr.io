If you do not see payment to your\n        PayPal account within 4 business days or if you don’t get an email from PayPal, this probably means that the\n        transfer has failed.

If you do\n        not see the payment in your account within 5-7 business days, this probably means that the transfer has failed.\n        In this case, your bank will contact us within 5-7 business days to inform Grabr of the incomplete transfer.\n        Grabr will notify you about this issue and will advise how to go about making necessary corrections.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Note: Your first payment may take up to 10 business days to transfer over.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n        Why do I receive my first payment after 7 days?\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n        Your first payment takes approximately 7 days to transfer because delaying your first payment is a condition of\n        our payment processor providing our members with a credit service.

Once you do so, you can request a new payment transfer in the payout options page\n        of your Grabr account. Alternatively, you can update the bank details in your account to one that does currently\n        accept transfers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <em>Bank ownership changed</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What this means: Your bank merged with another bank. As a result, your bank account details (such as your\n        routing number) has changed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What to do about it: Update the bank details in your payout options page.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <em>Account frozen</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What this means: Your bank notified us that your account was frozen.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What to do about it: Please contact your bank to resolve the issue.

This typically means that you have linked a savings or other type of non-checking bank\n        account with your Stripe account.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What to do about it: Please link a valid checking account to your Stripe account. If you already have a valid\n        checking account linked with Stripe, please contact your bank to understand why the transfer isn’t going\n        through. Once you have resolved the issue, you can request a new payment transfer in the payout options page of\n        your Grabr account.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <em>Could not process</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What it means: Something unexpected happened and your bank account was unable to process the payment Stripe\n        transferred it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What to do about it: Get in touch with us or your bank to resolve the issue.

For example, if the traveler put the item into checked baggage on a flight and the bag was lost or destroyed through no fault of the traveler, the loss would fall upon the shopper.  Grabr has arranged for travelers and shoppers who want to insure a high-value item to have access to insurance on reasonable terms.

Grabr will investigate the incident, and may terminate the account of the Member whose conduct led to the safety concern.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      Prohibited Items\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      It is the responsibility of the traveler to inspect any item being transported, making a reasonable attempt to confirm that it is not a prohibited item.
